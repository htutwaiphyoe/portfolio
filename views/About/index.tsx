        {`Hello, I'm Htut Wai Phyo, a software engineer currently based in
        Thailand. My academic journey in Computer Science began at Mandalay
        Technological University, where I reached my 4th year before deciding to
        follow a different path and pursued my Bachelor's degree at the
        University of Greenwich. In 2021, I
        started my professional journey as a frontend developer at CodigoSG and
        I was an integral part of the Rezerv SaaS platform. Beyond my
        professional work, I am passionate about contributing to the community
        by participating in open-source projects and sharing valuable insights through high-quality blogs and podcasts.
